# The Go Programming Language

Authors: Alan A. A. Donovan Â· Brian W. Kernighan
ISBN: 978-0134190440
Pages: 380pp

Fantastic book with clear explanations, interesting examples and seems to always have the answer to any obscure cornercase questions I might come up with. Also does contain relevant and well desgined exercises.

Obviously missing some newer features like Go1.13 error handling but most content is still valid.
